# Spotify Accounts Authentication Examples

This project is built using a template that contains basic demos showing the different OAuth 2.0 flows for [authenticating against the Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/).

    $ cd authorization_code
    $ node app.js

Open `http://localhost:8888` in a browser after starting up authorization_codes/app.js using node.
Very much in progress.
